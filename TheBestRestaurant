The Best Restaurant available.


With this project we intend to group sets of people based on the chosen restaurants, 
notes given to the same and other informationpassed by users. For one city (city A)

With the modeling of these groups we intend to verify which would be the nearest restaurants indicated
for individuals from another city (city b), visiting city A.


so we'll need to use:
Clustering algorithms based on the users' information to determine which restaurant would be the indicated.
And routing algorithms to choose from the closest restaurant.
